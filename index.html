        <h3>Geo-Eyes Coordinate Finder</h3>
        <h3 class="working_guide">
            How It Works: <br>
1.	User Input: <br>
	The surveyor inputs the easting and northing coordinates of the point they are interested in. <br>
2.	Database Search: <br>
	The application searches through a pre-uploaded database of existing coordinates (pillars) <br> within Oyo State to find the three closest points to the input coordinate. <br>
3.	Distance Calculation: <br>
	The application calculates the Euclidean distance between the input coordinate and each point <br> in the database to determine proximity. <br>
4.	Results Display: <br>
	The application displays the three nearest points along with their coordinates and the calculated <br> distances.

    <h3 class="use_case">
        Use Case Scenario: <br>
Imagine a surveyor is working in a remote area within Oyo State and needs to establish a new survey point. By using the Geo-Coord-Finder, they can: <br>
1.	Input the current coordinates into the application. <br>
2.	Instantly receive the three closest existing pillars, along with their distances. <br>
3.	Use this information to connect the new point to the existing survey network, ensuring accuracy and efficiency in their measurements. <br>
