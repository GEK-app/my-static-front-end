        Future Plans: <br>
Currently, the Geo-Coord-Finder is designed specifically for surveyors and geospatial experts within Oyo State, Nigeria. However, GEO-EYES KONSULTS plans to extend this valuable tool to other parts of Nigeria, providing the same benefits and efficiencies to surveyors nationwide.
This application thus serves as an invaluable tool for surveyors, enhancing their ability to perform accurate and efficient fieldwork by leveraging existing data, and it represents the commitment of GEO-EYES KONSULTS to improving geospatial operations within Nigeria. <br><br>

<h3 class="benefit">
    Benefits for Surveyors: <br>
1.	Efficiency: <br>
	Quickly identifies the nearest reference points, saving time in the field. <br>
2.	Accuracy: <br>
	Reduces human error in locating existing pillars by providing precise coordinates and distances. <br>
3.	Convenience: <br>
	Accessible from any device with internet access, making it versatile for use in various field conditions. <br> 
4.	Improved Workflow: <br>
	Streamlines the process of connecting to existing pillars, facilitating more efficient survey operations. <br>
5.	Scalability: <br>
	The application can be easily updated with new coordinates, ensuring it remains a useful tool as new pillars are added. <br>
